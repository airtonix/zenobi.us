I primarily work with [Django][1], [Tastypie][2] and [AngularJS][3].

Since 2006, I've moved to using Linux based operating systems (mostly [Ubuntu][4]), where I like to make use of server side technolgies like [Postgres][5], [Redis][6], [uWsgi][7], [Nginx][8], [Ansible][9] and [OpenSsh][10]. On the desktop I'm fairly proficient with [W.I.N.E.][11] and [Winetricks][12] which allows me to play pretty much all the triple A game titles. As far as development goes, I'm mainly a [NoPSD][13] kind of guy, so my interfaces are designed with [SublimeText 3][14], [Sass][15], [Compass][16] and [Zurb Foundation][17]. Sometimes I use [RatchetJS][18], [Topcoat][19]. If I need photos or Vector Art I am quite capable with [Gimp][20] and [Inkscape][21].

As far as artwork goes, you can checkout the sketches on my [google+ profile][22]

I'm greatly impressed with [git-flow], [github], [gitlab], [gitlab_ci], [bitbucket] and [travis-ci].

A lot of my experience with highly available and horizontally scalable web applications comes from working with [Amazon EC2], [Postgresql], [Django][1], [Nginx][8] and [uWsgi][7].

If you feel like asking me a technical question I'd be happy to either give you my advice/opinon or if I'm not able to give you an answer I'll more than likely know someone who can.
