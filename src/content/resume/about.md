It surprises me, that even after 14 years combined industry experience in web development that the horizon brings new tricks to keep me entertained.

I compliment teams lazy enough to investigate automating the mundane, a team that shrinks in horror at the thought of deployment without quality control. A team that modularises their toolkit for the world to use... We all dream of being some kind of leader in knowledge creation.

While being familiar with most work flows and modern open source frameworks, You'll find my efficiency is greatest with ES6, Scss, VueJS, Webpack, NodeJS, Python and Django.

At the moment I'm in Adelaide, Australia and willing to consider offers of relocation pretty much anywhere in the world.
