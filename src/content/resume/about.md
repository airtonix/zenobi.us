Zenobius is an enthusiastic, quality driven individual with over 11 years combined industry experience in web development. Constantly striving to expand his repertoire through learning new frameworks, strategies and techniques, but overall setting a goal  to establish robustly scalable and maintainable team development process that survives contact with real life scenarios, higher team participation and lower technical debit.

Always searching for a team composed of top performers, a team lazy enough to investigate automating the mundane, a team that raises the collective expertise to new industry standards.

While being familiar with most workflows and modern opensource frameworks, Zenobius prefers to work with Coffescript, Es6, Scss, VueJS, Webpack, Nodejs, Python and Django. These are not concrete determinations however, since from time to time he will be evaluating other options that present better workflow oppurtunities.

At the moment Zenobius is in Adelaide, Australia and willing to consider offers of relocation pretty much anywhere in the world.
