To whom it may concern,

As above, I am Zenobius. A passionate contributor to open source projects and developer of [Django][1] Web Applications (both front and back end).

I've been using Django and Python for a wide range of purposes over the last four years most recently I was the lead developer at zibmedia where I was responsible for everything technical. I primarily conceptualised, planned, designed and created several revolutionary products for Chris Knights (Richmond, AFL).

My experience with Linux is mainly with Ubuntu. Since 2005 I've been using it for
both my desktop and laptop for the last nine years. I've become proficient in
"best practice" use and deployment of a linux server in the scenario of horizontally scalable
web applications.

I really enjoy using Python and the Django framework, and I've released quite a few
projects as opensource through github as "[airtonix][2]".

The following is a brief summary of the qualifications and experience I would
bring to this position:

* 13yrs hand coding HTML, CSS & Javascript.
* 2yr utlising [Sass][3] and [Compass][4] with [Zurb Foundation][5].
* 1yr utilising [LessCSS][6] and [Bootstrap][7]
* 4yrs Python and Django programming.
* 3yrs creating [Drupal][8] Websites.
* 9yrs using Linux for Server and Desktop environments, ranging from Gaming, Graphic Design
Programming
* Attention to detail and adherence to quality programming and demonstrated by my
projects on github.
* An approach to deployment and provisioning that promotes horizontal scalabilty
* 1 Year experience as a Team Leader with Heta Incorporated.
* 2.5 Years experience as a Team Leader with Zibmedia Pty Ltd

Finally to close off, I'd like to mention that I'm receptive to relocation should the right conditions be presented. Otherwise I would like to suggest that initially we explore remote working with daily structured Skype meetings.
